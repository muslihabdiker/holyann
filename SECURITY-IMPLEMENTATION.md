# Security Implementation

## Features
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Supported via TOTP and hardware tokens.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects APIs from brute force attacks.

## Threat Modeling
- Identified Risks:
  - SQL Injection
  - XSS Attacks
- Mitigations:
  - Parameterized queries for database operations.
  - Input sanitization using `DOMPurify`.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of Zero Trust Architecture.
