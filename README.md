   - 🕰️ Time-travel debugging to easily track and reproduce state changes.

### **6. Performance Optimizations**
   - ⚡ Out-of-the-box optimizations such as **lazy loading**, **code splitting**, **tree shaking**, and **caching** ensure your application performs at its best, regardless of its size.
   - 🔍 Automatic code analysis to identify and eliminate dead code.
   - 📊 Built-in performance profiling tools to help you identify and fix bottlenecks.
   - 🗜️ Automatic minification and compression of assets for faster load times.
